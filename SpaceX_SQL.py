# Using this Python notebook you will:

# Understand the Spacex DataSet
# Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
# Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

# Let us first load the SQL extension and establish a connection with the database

# %sql create table SPACEXTABLE as select * from SPACEXTBL where Date is not null

# Now write and execute SQL queries to solve the assignment tasks.
