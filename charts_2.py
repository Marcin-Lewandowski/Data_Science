# Importing Data - Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision from United Nation's website.

df_can = pd.read_csv('https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/Canada.csv')

print('Data read into a pandas dataframe!')
print(df_can.head(5))

# Let's find out how many entries there are in our dataset.
# print the dimensions of the dataframe
print(df_can.shape)

# Visualizing Data using Matplotlib
# For plotting the data easilty, let's first set the country name as index - useful for quickly looking up countries using .loc method.

df_can.set_index('Country', inplace=True)
# Let's view the first five elements and see how the dataframe was changed
df_can.head()

# Notice now the country names now serve as indices.

print('data dimensions:', df_can.shape)

# Finally, let's create a list of years from 1980 - 2013, this will come in handy when we start plotting the data

years = list(map(str, range(1980, 2014)))


# Pie Charts - A pie chart is a circular graphic that displays numeric proportions by dividing a circle (or pie) into proportional slices. 
# You are most likely already familiar with pie charts as it is widely used in business and media. We can create pie charts in Matplotlib by passing in the kind=pie keyword.

# Let's use a pie chart to explore the proportion (percentage) of new immigrants grouped by continents for the entire time period from 1980 to 2013.

# Step 1: Gather data.

# We will use pandas groupby method to summarize the immigration data by Continent. The general process of groupby involves the following steps:

# Split: Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.
# Apply: Applying a function to each group independently: .sum() .count() .mean() .std() .aggregate() .apply() .etc..
# Combine: Combining the results into a data structure.

# group countries by continents and apply sum() function 
df_continents = df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0).sum()

# note: the output of the groupby method is a `groupby' object. 
# we can not use it further until we apply a function (eg .sum())
print(type(df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0)))

df_continents.head()

# Step 2: Plot the data. We will pass in kind = 'pie' keyword, along with the following additional parameters:

# autopct - is a string or function used to label the wedges with their numeric value. The label will be placed inside the wedge. If it is a format string, the label will be fmt%pct.
# startangle - rotates the start of the pie chart by angle degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis.
# shadow - Draws a shadow beneath the pie (to give a 3D feel).


# autopct create %, start angle represent starting point
df_continents['Total'].plot(kind='pie',
                            figsize=(5, 6),
                            autopct='%1.1f%%', # add in percentages
                            startangle=90,     # start angle 90Â° (Africa)
                            shadow=True,       # add shadow

# The above visual is not very clear, the numbers and text overlap in some instances. Let's make a few modifications to improve the visuals:

# Remove the text labels on the pie chart by passing in legend and add it as a seperate legend using plt.legend().
# Push out the percentages to sit just outside the pie chart by passing in pctdistance parameter.
# Pass in a custom set of colors for continents by passing in colors parameter.
# Explode the pie chart to emphasize the lowest three continents (Africa, North America, and Latin America and Caribbean) by passing in explode parameter.

# Box Plots 
# A box plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of the data through five main dimensions:

# Minimum: The smallest number in the dataset excluding the outliers.
# First quartile: Middle number between the minimum and the median.
# Second quartile (Median): Middle number of the (sorted) dataset.
# Third quartile: Middle number between median and maximum.
# Maximum: The largest number in the dataset excluding the outliers.

# To make a boxplot, we can use kind=box in plot method invoked on a pandas series or dataframe.

# Let's plot the box plot for the Japanese immigrants between 1980 - 2013.

# Step 1: Get the subset of the dataset. Even though we are extracting the data for just one country, we will obtain it as a dataframe. 
# This will help us with calling the dataframe.describe() method to view the percentiles.


# to get a dataframe, place extra square brackets around 'Japan'.
df_japan = df_can.loc[['Japan'], years].transpose()
df_japan.head()

# Step 2: Plot by passing in kind='box'.


df_japan.plot(kind='box', figsize=(8, 6))

plt.title('Box plot of Japanese Immigrants from 1980 - 2013')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()


# We can immediately make a few key observations from the plot above:

# The minimum number of immigrants is around 200 (min), maximum number is around 1300 (max), and median number of immigrants is around 900 (median).
# 25% of the years for period 1980 - 2013 had an annual immigrant count of ~500 or fewer (First quartile).
# 75% of the years for period 1980 - 2013 had an annual immigrant count of ~1100 or fewer (Third quartile).
# We can view the actual numbers by calling the describe() method on the dataframe.

print(df_japan.describe())

# Task - Compare the distribution of the number of new immigrants from India and China for the period 1980 - 2013.

# Step 1: Get the dataset for China and India and call the dataframe df_CI.


df_CI= df_can.loc[['China', 'India'], years].transpose()
df_CI.head()

# Let's view the percentiles associated with both countries using the describe() method.

df_CI.describe()

# Step 2: Plot data.

df_CI.plot(kind='box', figsize=(10, 7))

plt.title('Box plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()


# We can observe that, while both countries have around the same median immigrant population (~20,000), China's immigrant population range is more spread out than India's. 
# The maximum population from India for any year (36,210) is around 15% lower than the maximum population from China (42,584).

# If you prefer to create horizontal box plots, you can pass the vert parameter in the plot function and assign it to False. 
# You can also specify a different color in case you are not a big fan of the default red color.

# horizontal box plots
df_CI.plot(kind='box', figsize=(10, 7), color='blue', vert=False)

plt.title('Box plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()


'''
Subplots

Often times we might want to plot multiple plots within the same figure. For example, we might want to perform a side by side comparison of the box plot with the line plot of China and India's immigration.

To visualize multiple plots together, we can create a figure (overall canvas) and divide it into subplots, each containing a plot. With subplots, we usually work with the artist layer instead of the scripting layer.

Typical syntax is :

    fig = plt.figure() # create figure
    ax = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number) # create subplots

Where nrows and ncols are used to notionally split the figure into (nrows * ncols) sub-axes,
plot_number is used to identify the particular subplot that this function is to create within the notional grid. plot_number starts at 1, increments across rows first and has a maximum of nrows * ncols as shown below.

'''


# We can then specify which subplot to place each plot by passing in the ax paramemter in plot() method as follows:


fig = plt.figure() # create figure

ax0 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1) # add subplot 1 (1 row, 2 columns, first plot)
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2) # add subplot 2 (1 row, 2 columns, second plot). See tip below**

# Subplot 1: Box plot
df_CI.plot(kind='box', color='blue', vert=False, figsize=(20, 6), ax=ax0) # add to subplot 1
ax0.set_title('Box Plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
ax0.set_xlabel('Number of Immigrants')
ax0.set_ylabel('Countries')

# Subplot 2: Line plot
df_CI.plot(kind='line', figsize=(20, 6), ax=ax1) # add to subplot 2
ax1.set_title ('Line Plots of Immigrants from China and India (1980 - 2013)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Immigrants')
ax1.set_xlabel('Years')

plt.show()

# Task - Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of the top 15 countries (based on total immigration) grouped by the decades 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.

# Step 1: Get the dataset. Get the top 15 countries based on Total immigrant population. Name the dataframe df_top15.

df_top15 = df_can.sort_values(['Total'], ascending=False, axis=0).head(15)
df_top15

# Step 2: Create a new dataframe which contains the aggregate for each decade. One way to do that:

# Create a list of all years in decades 80's, 90's, and 00's.
# Slice the original dataframe df_can to create a series for each decade and sum across all years for each country.
# Merge the three series into a new data frame. Call your dataframe new_df.

# create a list of all years in decades 80's, 90's, and 00's
years_80s = list(map(str, range(1980, 1990))) 
years_90s = list(map(str, range(1990, 2000))) 
years_00s = list(map(str, range(2000, 2010))) 

# slice the original dataframe df_can to create a series for each decade
df_80s = df_top15.loc[:, years_80s].sum(axis=1) 
df_90s = df_top15.loc[:, years_90s].sum(axis=1) 
df_00s = df_top15.loc[:, years_00s].sum(axis=1)

# merge the three series into a new data frame
new_df = pd.DataFrame({'1980s': df_80s, '1990s': df_90s, '2000s':df_00s}) 

# display dataframe
new_df.head()



# Let's learn more about the statistics associated with the dataframe using the describe() method.

new_df.describe()

# Step 3: Plot the box plots.

new_df.plot(kind='box', figsize=(10, 6))

plt.title('Immigration from top 15 countries for decades 80s, 90s and 2000s')

plt.show()

'''
Note how the box plot differs from the summary table created. The box plot scans the data and identifies the outliers. In order to be an outlier, the data value must be:

larger than Q3 by at least 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), or,
smaller than Q1 by at least 1.5 times the IQR.
Let's look at decade 2000s as an example:

Q1 (25%) = 36,101.5
Q3 (75%) = 105,505.5
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 69,404
Using the definition of outlier, any value that is greater than Q3 by 1.5 times IQR will be flagged as outlier.

Outlier > 105,505.5 + (1.5 * 69,404)
Outlier > 209,611.5
'''
  
new_df=new_df.reset_index()
new_df[new_df['2000s']> 209611.5]


'''
Scatter Plots
A scatter plot (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. Scatter plots look similar to line plots in that they both map independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the data points are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.

Let's start by exploring the following:

Using a scatter plot, let's visualize the trend of total immigrantion to Canada (all countries combined) for the years 1980 - 2013.
'''


# Step 1: Get the dataset. Since we are expecting to use the relationship betewen years and total population, we will convert years to int type

# we can use the sum() method to get the total population per year
df_tot = pd.DataFrame(df_can[years].sum(axis=0))

# change the years to type int (useful for regression later on)
df_tot.index = map(int, df_tot.index)

# reset the index to put in back in as a column in the df_tot dataframe
df_tot.reset_index(inplace = True)

# rename columns
df_tot.columns = ['year', 'total']

# view the final dataframe
df_tot.head()


# Step 2: Plot the data. In Matplotlib, we can create a scatter plot set by passing in kind='scatter' as plot argument. 
# We will also need to pass in x and y keywords to specify the columns that go on the x- and the y-axis.

df_tot.plot(kind='scatter', x='year', y='total', figsize=(10, 6), color='darkblue')

plt.title('Total Immigration to Canada from 1980 - 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()


'''
Notice how the scatter plot does not connect the data points together. We can clearly observe an upward trend in the data: as the years go by, the total number of immigrants increases. 
We can mathematically analyze this upward trend using a regression line (line of best fit).

So let's try to plot a linear line of best fit, and use it to predict the number of immigrants in 2015.

Step 1: Get the equation of line of best fit. We will use Numpy's polyfit() method by passing in the following:

x: x-coordinates of the data.
y: y-coordinates of the data.
deg: Degree of fitting polynomial. 1 = linear, 2 = quadratic, and so on.
'''


x = df_tot['year']      # year on x-axis
y = df_tot['total']     # total on y-axis
fit = np.polyfit(x, y, deg=1)

fit

# The output is an array with the polynomial coefficients, highest powers first. 
# Since we are plotting a linear regression y= a * x + b, our output has 2 elements [5.56709228e+03, -1.09261952e+07] with the the slope in position 0 and intercept in position 1.

# Step 2: Plot the regression line on the scatter plot.


df_tot.plot(kind='scatter', x='year', y='total', figsize=(10, 6), color='darkblue')

plt.title('Total Immigration to Canada from 1980 - 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

# plot line of best fit
plt.plot(x, fit[0] * x + fit[1], color='red') # recall that x is the Years
plt.annotate('y={0:.0f} x + {1:.0f}'.format(fit[0], fit[1]), xy=(2000, 150000))

plt.show()

# print out the line of best fit
'No. Immigrants = {0:.0f} * Year + {1:.0f}'.format(fit[0], fit[1])

# Using the equation of line of best fit, we can estimate the number of immigrants in 2015:

# No. Immigrants = 5567 * Year - 10926195
# No. Immigrants = 5567 * 2015 - 10926195
# No. Immigrants = 291,310


# Task -  Create a scatter plot of the total immigration from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to Canada from 1980 to 2013?
# Step 1: Get the data:

# Create a dataframe the consists of the numbers associated with Denmark, Norway, and Sweden only. Name it df_countries.
# Sum the immigration numbers across all three countries for each year and turn the result into a dataframe. Name this new dataframe df_total.
# Reset the index in place.
# Rename the columns to year and total.
# Display the resulting dataframe.

# create df_countries dataframe
df_countries = df_can.loc[['Denmark', 'Norway', 'Sweden'], years].transpose()

# create df_total by summing across three countries for each year
df_total = pd.DataFrame(df_countries.sum(axis=1))

# reset index in place
df_total.reset_index(inplace=True)

# rename columns
df_total.columns = ['year', 'total']

# change column year from string to int to create scatter plot
df_total['year'] = df_total['year'].astype(int)

# show resulting dataframe
df_total.head()



# Step 2: Generate the scatter plot by plotting the total versus year in df_total.

# generate scatter plot
df_total.plot(kind='scatter', x='year', y='total', figsize=(10, 6), color='darkblue')

# add title and label to axes
plt.title('Immigration from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to Canada from 1980 - 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

# show plot
plt.show()

'''
Bubble Plots Â¶
A bubble plot is a variation of the scatter plot that displays three dimensions of data (x, y, z). The data points are replaced with bubbles, and the size of the bubble is determined by the third variable z, also known as the weight. In maplotlib, we can pass in an array or scalar to the parameter s to plot(), that contains the weight of each point.

Let's start by analyzing the effect of Argentina's great depression.

Argentina suffered a great depression from 1998 to 2002, which caused widespread unemployment, riots, the fall of the government, and a default on the country's foreign debt. In terms of income, over 50% of Argentines were poor, and seven out of ten Argentine children were poor at the depth of the crisis in 2002.

Let's analyze the effect of this crisis, and compare Argentina's immigration to that of it's neighbour Brazil. Let's do that using a bubble plot of immigration from Brazil and Argentina for the years 1980 - 2013. We will set the weights for the bubble as the normalized value of the population for each year.

'''

# Step 1: Get the data for Brazil and Argentina. Like in the previous example, we will convert the Years to type int and include it in the dataframe.

# transposed dataframe
df_can_t = df_can[years].transpose()

# cast the Years (the index) to type int
df_can_t.index = map(int, df_can_t.index)

# let's label the index. This will automatically be the column name when we reset the index
df_can_t.index.name = 'Year'

# reset index to bring the Year in as a column
df_can_t.reset_index(inplace=True)

# view the changes
df_can_t.head()


# Step 2: Create the normalized weights

# normalize Brazil data
norm_brazil = (df_can_t['Brazil'] - df_can_t['Brazil'].min()) / (df_can_t['Brazil'].max() - df_can_t['Brazil'].min())

# normalize Argentina data
norm_argentina = (df_can_t['Argentina'] - df_can_t['Argentina'].min()) / (df_can_t['Argentina'].max() - df_can_t['Argentina'].min())


# Step 3: Plot the data.

# To plot two different scatter plots in one plot, we can include the axes one plot into the other by passing it via the ax parameter.
# We will also pass in the weights using the s parameter. Given that the normalized weights are between 0-1, they won't be visible on the plot. Therefore, we will:
# multiply weights by 2000 to scale it up on the graph, and,
# add 10 to compensate for the min value (which has a 0 weight and therefore scale with  x 2000).



# Brazil
ax0 = df_can_t.plot(kind='scatter',
                    x='Year',

# Task - Previously in this lab, we created box plots to compare immigration from China and India to Canada. Create bubble plots of immigration from China and India to visualize any differences with time from 1980 to 2013. You can use df_can_t that we defined and used in the previous example.

# Step 1: Normalize the data pertaining to China and India.
